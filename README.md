# InsightTree

Insight Tree breaks down a metric into a hierarchy (tree) and highlights the insights from that metric.

This is implemented as a component at [@gramex/insighttree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gramex/insighttree).

This application is a front-end to the `@gramex/insighttree` component. It reads data from a CSV file, and displays it as an InsightTree.

It is deployed at <https://insighttree.straive.app>.
